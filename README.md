# Regression Model (Teresa)
Since we have such a large number of train data, we chose to randomly sample 10,000 observations from train data to build the model. 
The final model uses the following variables: ps_ind_15 + ps_ind_17_bin + ps_reg_03 + ps_car_01_cat + ps_car_09_cat + ps_car_11 + ps_car_12 + ps_car_13 + ps_car_14 + ps_car_15 + ps_calc_02 + ps_calc_09 + ps_ind_09_bin
