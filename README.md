# Linear Model (Teresa)
Since we have such a large number of observations, instead of using all the observations, we randomly chose 10,000 observations from train data to select variables and build the model.
Using stepwise regression, we were able to choose (ps_ind_15 + ps_ind_17_bin + ps_reg_03 + ps_car_01_cat + ps_car_09_cat + ps_car_11 + ps_car_12 + ps_car_13 + ps_car_14 + ps_car_15 + ps_calc_02 + ps_calc_09 + ps_ind_09_bin) as parameters to build logistic regression model.
